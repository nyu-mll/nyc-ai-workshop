                <h2>About NYC AI Workshop</h2>
                <p>The NYC AI Workshop is a 2-day introductory workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, organized by the members of NYU's <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/">Machine Learning for Lanugage Lab</a>.</p>
                <p>Our hope is to provide an introduction to AI and ML to early year undergraduate students in New York City area. In particular, this workshop is designed for people without a computer science background. So no coding experience is needed!</p>
                <p>The workshop is free and we'll cover all costs! There will, of course, be food. </p>
                <p>The application will be open soon! Sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/3/d/182PpuZ10_Un37eIB-y-18MWpuKXaCSxcBdIKV238xr8/edit">here</a> to get updates about when the applicaiton goes live.</p>
