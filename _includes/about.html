                <h2>About NYC AI Workshop</h2>
                <p>NYC AI Workshop is a 2-day introductory workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, organized by the members of NYU's <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/">Machine Learning for Lanugage Lab</a>.</p>
                <p>Our hope is to provide an introducion to AI and ML to early year undergraduate students in New York City area. In particular, this workshop is designed for people without a computer science background. So no coding experience is needed!</p>
                <p>The workshop is application based and free! And of course, there will be food. </p>
                <p>The application will be open soon!</p>
                <p>NYC AI Workshop is funded by <a href="http://msdse.org/">Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments</a>.</p>
